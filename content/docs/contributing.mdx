## Creating an issue

Before creating an issue please ensure that the problem is not [already reported](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/issues).

If you want to report a bug, create a reproduction using StackBlitz or CodeSandbox. If you want to request a feature, add motivation section and some usage examples.

## Sending a Pull Request

1. fork and clone the repository
2. create a development branch from `v3`
3. install dependencies from the root of the repo (`node@18` and `npm@8` are required):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   Note: this command installs dependencies for all packages, but only builds packages included in `@reatom/framework`, like `core`, `utils`, `async`, etc.
4. build the package you are editing from the root of the repo:
   ```sh
   npx turbo run build --filter=<PACKAGE_NAME>
   ```
   Replace `<PACKAGE_NAME>` with the relevant package name like `persist` or `npm-react`
5. [make changes](#coding-guide) and [commit them](#commit-messages)
6. upload feature branch and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/compare) to merge changes to `v3`
7. link your PR to the issue using a [closing keyword](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) or provide changes description with motivation and explanation in the comment (example: `fix #74`)
8. wait until a team member responds

## Creating a package

The goal of Reatom ecosystem is to provide adapters for Web APIs and popular npm modules. Therefore, the process of creating a new package is almost identical to editing an existing one ([Sending a Pull Request](#sending-a-pull-request)), but you should also create the package using an interactive script ran in the repository root:

```sh
npm run package-generator
```

Add needed dependencies by running `npm install` in your package's directory. If you're making an adapter for a particular npm library (like `@reatom/npm-react` for React), the library should be saved as peer: `npm install --save-peer <LIBRARY>`


### Package naming rule

Packages that integrate Reatom with external APIs should have their names prefixed with API or library source kind: `node-`, `npm-`, `web-`. For example, [`@reatom/npm-history`](https://reatom.dev/package/npm-history) provides an adapter for the [`history`](https://npmjs.com/history) package. Similarly, a potential adapter for [Web History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) would be named `@reatom/web-history`.

## Coding guide

- bug fixes should also add tests that reproduce the addressed bug
- all new features should be tested and documented
- use `// @ts-expect-error` if you sure that error is a mistake 

## Commit messages

Commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

### Allowed `<type>`

- `chore`: any repository maintainance changes
- `feat`: code change that adds a new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `perf`: code change that improves performance
- `refactor`: code change that is neither a feature addition nor a bug fix nor a performance improvement
- `docs`: documentation only changes
- `ci`: a change made to CI configurations and scripts
- `style`: cosmetic code change
- `test`: change that only adds or corrects tests
- `revert`: change that reverts previous commits

### Allowed `<scope>`

Package directory name. Eg: `/packages/effects` is scoped as `effects`.

### `<description>` rules

- should be written in English
- should be in imperative mood (like `change` instead `changed` or `changes`)
- should not be capitalized
- should not have period (`.`) at the end

### Commit message examples

```
docs: fix typo in npm-react
fix(core): add check for atoms with equal ids
```
